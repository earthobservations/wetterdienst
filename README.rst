Introduction
************

Welcome to Wetterdienst, your friendly weather service library for Python.

We are a group of like-minded people trying to make access to weather data in
Python feel like a warm summer breeze, similar to other projects like
rdwd_ for the R language, which originally drew our interest in this project.
Our long-term goal is to provide access to multiple weather services as well as other
related agencies such as river measurements. With ``wetterdienst`` we try to use modern
Python technologies all over the place. The library is based on pandas_ across the board,
uses Poetry_ for package administration and GitHub Actions for all things CI.
Our users are an important part of the development as we are not currently using the
data we are providing and only implement what we think would be the best. Therefore
contributions and feedback whether it be data related or library related are very
welcome! Just hand in a PR or Issue if you think we should include a new feature or data
source.

Acknowledgements
****************

We want to acknowledge all environmental agencies which provide their data open and free
of charge first and foremost for the sake of endless research possibilities.

We want to acknowledge Jetbrains_ and their `open source team`_ for providing us with
licenses for Pycharm Pro, which we are using for the development.

We want to acknowledge all contributors for being part of the improvements to this
library that make it better and better every day.

Docker
======

Docker images for each stable release will get pushed to GitHub Container Registry.

There are images in two variants, ``wetterdienst-standard`` and ``wetterdienst-full``.

``wetterdienst-standard`` will contain a minimum set of 3rd-party packages,
while ``wetterdienst-full`` will try to serve a full environment by also
including packages like GDAL and wradlib.

Pull the Docker image:

.. code-block:: bash

    docker pull ghcr.io/earthobservations/wetterdienst-standard

Library
-------
Use the latest stable version of ``wetterdienst``:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run -ti ghcr.io/earthobservations/wetterdienst-standard
    Python 3.8.5 (default, Sep 10 2020, 16:58:22)
    [GCC 8.3.0] on linux

.. code-block:: python

    import wetterdienst
    wetterdienst.__version__

Command line script
-------------------
The ``wetterdienst`` command is also available:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Make an alias to use it conveniently from your shell.
    alias wetterdienst='docker run -ti ghcr.io/earthobservations/wetterdienst-standard wetterdienst'

    wetterdienst --help
    wetterdienst version
    wetterdienst info

Example
*******

Acquisition of historical data for specific stations using ``wetterdienst`` as library:

Load required request class:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> pd.options.display.max_columns = 8
    >>> from wetterdienst.provider.dwd.observation import DwdObservationRequest
    >>> from wetterdienst import Settings

Alternatively, though without argument/type hinting:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from wetterdienst import Wetterdienst
    >>> API = Wetterdienst("dwd", "observation")

Get data:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> Settings.tidy = True  # default, tidy data
    >>> Settings.humanize = True  # default, humanized parameters
    >>> Settings.si_units = True  # default, convert values to SI units
    >>> request = DwdObservationRequest(
    ...    parameter=["climate_summary"],
    ...    resolution="daily",
    ...    start_date="1990-01-01",  # if not given timezone defaulted to UTC
    ...    end_date="2020-01-01",  # if not given timezone defaulted to UTC
    ... ).filter_by_station_id(station_id=(1048, 4411))
    >>> request.df.head()  # station list

Contribution
************

There are different ways in which you can contribute to this library:

- by handing in a PR which describes the feature/issue that was solved including tests
  for newly added features
- by using our library and reporting bugs to us either by mail or by creating a new
  Issue
- by letting us know either via issue or discussion what function or data source we may
  include into this library describing possible solutions or acquisition
  methods/endpoints/APIs

Development
***********

1. Clone the library and install the environment.

   This setup procedure will outline how to install the library and the minimum
   dependencies required to run the whole test suite. If, for some reason, you
   are not available to install all the packages, just leave out some of the
   "extras" dependency tags.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/earthobservations/wetterdienst
    cd wetterdienst

    # Prerequisites
    brew install --cask firefox
    brew install git python geckodriver

    # Option 1: Basic
    git clone https://github.com/earthobservations/wetterdienst
    cd wetterdienst
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install --requirement=requirements.txt
    python setup.py develop

    # (Option 2: Install package with extras)
    pip install ".[sql,export,restapi,explorer]"

    # Option 3: Install package with extras using poetry.
    poetry install --extras=sql --extras=export --extras=restapi --extras=explorer
    poetry shell

2. For running the whole test suite, you will need to have Firefox and
   geckodriver installed on your machine. Install them like::

       # macOS
       brew install --cask firefox
       brew install geckodriver

       # Other OS
       # You can also get installers and/or release archives for Linux, macOS
       # and Windows at
       #
       # - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/
       # - https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

   If this does not work for some reason and you would like to skip ui-related
   tests on your machine, please invoke the test suite with::

       poe test -m "not ui"

3. Edit the source code, add corresponding tests and documentation for your
   changes. While editing, you might want to continuously run the test suite
   by invoking::

       poe test

   In order to run only specific tests, invoke::

       # Run tests by module name or function name.
       poe test -k test_cli

       # Run tests by tags.
       poe test -m "not (remote or slow)"

4. Before committing your changes, please als run those steps in order to make
   the patch adhere to the coding standards used here.

.. code-block:: bash

    poe format  # black code formatting
    poe lint    # lint checking
    poe export  # export of requirements (for Github Dependency Graph)

5. Push your changes and submit them as pull request

   Thank you in advance!


.. note::

    If you need to extend the list of package dependencies, invoke:

    .. code-block:: bash

        # Add package to runtime dependencies.
        poetry add new-package

        # Add package to development dependencies.
        poetry add --dev new-package



Known Issues
************

MAC ARM64 (M1)
