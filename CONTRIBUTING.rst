Contributions

Thank you for considering contributing to wetterdienst! We are an open community that works respectfully together on
environmental data. We are colorful mix of people: some of us have environmental background, others come from computer
science related fields. This also means that our contributions may differ in quality and preciseness however we are
welcoming you to contribute in any possible way whether it be

- requesting the implementation of a dataset by providing urls to the data/metadata source and rough descriptions of
  the data itself and its meaning to you
- sketching out new weather services and a possible way to access them
- "my notebook is running hot and my system seems to have crashed"
- you have spotted a very specific caching issue and know exactly how to handle it

This also means that contributions can be issues but also pull requests with specific code changes. Working on code you
may follow our development guide (documentation) to reduce the time used to setup your environment.

Whenever you reach out to us, probably Andreas Motl or me (Benjamin Gutzmann) will respond to you within a few days and
try to resolve your problem quickly.
