I/We originally started rebuilding
`rdwd <https://github.com/brry/rdwd>`_
in Python as a starting project, but soon got accompanied by others to make this work
as flawless as we can. We are always looking for others to join and bring in their own
ideas so please consider writing us! Below you can find more about contribution and the
most recent changelog of the library.

Contribution

As we are currently keeping development simple, so don't worry to much about style. If
you want a PR to be merged, describe what you changed at best precision and we guarantee
a fast merge. Otherwise if you have an idea of a problem or even better a solution just
let us know via an issue (you could also describe problem with words so we can figure
out how to solve it with a suitable programming solution).

For development clone the repository and install developer dependencies via

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/earthobservations/wetterdienst
    cd wetterdienst

    pip install .
    # or
    poetry install

Before committing, run black code formatter and lint to test for format.

.. code-block:: bash

    nox -s tests
    nox -s black
    nox -s lint

In order to run the tests more **quickly**::

    poetry install --extras=excel
    poetry shell
    pytest -vvvv -m "not (remote or slow)
