# DMO

## Overview

[DMO](https://www.dwd.de/DE/leistungen/met_verfahren_ptp_dmo/met_verfahren_ptp_dmo.html) is a new forecast product of 
the DWD that takes model output and extracts it at known meteorological stations to produce consumable timeseries. In 
opposition to the Mosmix product, DMO is not a statistical postprocessing but a pure extraction of model output. The DMO 
product is available for the ICON model in its global (ICON) and regional (ICON-EU) configuration. For ICON-EU, the DMO 
product is available in hourly resolution with a lead time of 78 hours. For ICON, the DMO product is available in hourly 
resolution with a lead time of 78 hours and in 3-hourly resolution with a lead time of 168 hours.
