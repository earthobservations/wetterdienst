# Frost

## Overview

The Frost API provides access to historical and recent observations from the Norwegian
Meteorological Institute's station network. An API client ID is required; register for
free at [frost.met.no](https://frost.met.no/auth/requestCredentials.html).

Set the client ID via the `WD_AUTH__METNO_FROST=<client_id>` environment variable or the
`Settings(auth={"metno_frost": "<client_id>"})` argument.

## Stations

The station list is Frost's catalogue of `SensorSystem` sources, about 2,200 entries. 24 of
them have no position: Frost gives them no `geometry`, and no latitude or longitude in any other
field. They are mobile platforms, such as ships (`SN76999` SCARABEO 8, `SN77049` MS ASTERIX,
`SN20930` POLARSTERN), rigs (`SN76946` ROSS RIG) and gliders (`SN20957` SG644 GLIDER), 20 of them
with ship codes, so there is no fixed place to state. They stay in the list with a null
`latitude` and `longitude`, and a search by distance or bounding box, an interpolation or a
summary never picks them.

## Time window

Every resolution needs a window: a request for values without a start and end date is refused
(REST API: 400, `timestamp` is required), because Frost is asked for one reference time range and
the answer without it would be empty. Stations can be listed without one.
