Global Historical Climatology Network

Overview
********

NOAA Global Historical Climatology Network is a collection of **hourly** and **daily** weather data put together from multiple weather
services around the world, even those where at this moment no data is publicly offered. Resolution is fixed on daily,
because this is the most common and maintainable resolution with most observations practiced all over the world.

The GHCN-Hourly dataset represents the previously existing ISD (Integrated Surface Database).
