********

Mosmix_ is a forecast product of the DWD that is based on global weather models and that
uses statistical downscaling for land-based climate stations based on their historical
observations to provide more precise, local forecast. Mosmix is available for over 5000
stations worldwide and is available in two versions, Mosmix-S and Mosmix-L. Mosmix-S
comes with a set of 40 parameters and is published every hour while MOSMIX-L has a set
of about 115 parameters and is released every 6 hours (3am, 9am, 3pm, 9pm). Both
versions have a forecast limit of 240h.
