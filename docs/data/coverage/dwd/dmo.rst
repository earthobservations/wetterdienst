DMO
###

Overview
********

DMO_ is a new forecast product of the DWD that takes model output and extracts it at known meteorological stations
to produce consumable timeseries. In opposition to the Mosmix product, DMO is not a statistical postprocessing
but a pure extraction of model output. The DMO product is available for the ICON model in its global (ICON) and regional
(ICON-EU) configuration. For ICON-EU, the DMO product is available in hourly resolution with a lead time of 78 hours.
For ICON, the DMO product is available in hourly resolution with a lead time of 78 hours and in 3-hourly resolution
with a lead time of 168 hours.
