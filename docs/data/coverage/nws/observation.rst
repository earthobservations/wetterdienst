NWS Observations

Overview
********

NOAA NWS Observation is a collection of **hourly** weather data from US weather stations. Resolution is fixed on hourly
and data is provided for the last week.

.. warning::

    Currently we use a somewhat not correct list of stations. For some stations no data may be returned, as they
    actually don't exist in the NWS Observation network!
