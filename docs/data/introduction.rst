Introduction
############

This chapter gives an outline on what data can be accessed through `wetterdienst` and under
which conditions. `wetterdienst` enables the user to access data from multiple agencies such
as the German Weather Service (DWD). Although the data is provided as open data, the user has
to give reference to the provider the data is coming from. We are providing links to the
several agencies and their policies with licensing. Check out those to make sure to give
correct reference!
