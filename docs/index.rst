Welcome to wetterdienst's documentation!
****************************************

Welcome to
`wetterdienst <https://github.com/earthobservations/wetterdienst>`_,
your friendly weather service library for Python from the
neighbourhood! We are an group of people, who try to make access to weather data in
Python feel like a warm summer breeze, similar to other projects like
`rdwd <https://github.com/brry/rdwd>`_ ,
which originally drew our interest in this project. As we reach to provide you with data
from multiple weather services, we are still stuck with this one weather service from
Germany, that has questioned our believe in humanity. But we think we are at good
condition to make further progress to soon fully cover the German weather service, right
after finishing this documentation. But now it's up to you to take a closer look at
what we did here.
