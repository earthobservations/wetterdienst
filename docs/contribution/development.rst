Development sandbox

************
Introduction
************

Whether you are working on an issue, trying to implement a new feature, or adding
a new weather service, you'll need a proper sandbox environment. The following
procedure outlines how to setup such an environment.

This setup procedure will outline how to install the library and the minimum
dependencies required to run the whole test suite.

If, for some reason, you are not available to install all the packages, just
leave out some of the ``extras`` dependency groups.


*********************************
Acquire sources and prerequisites
*********************************

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/earthobservations/wetterdienst
    cd wetterdienst

    # Prerequisites
    brew install git python uv

    # Other OS
    # You can also get installers and/or release archives for Linux, macOS
    # and Windows at
    #
    # - https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/releases


********
Using uv
********

.. code-block:: bash

    uv sync
    uv run poe install-dev

*********
Using pip
*********

.. code-block:: bash

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install package in "editable" mode.
    pip install --editable=".[sql,export,restapi,explorer,interpolation]"


*********
Run tests
*********

For running the whole test suite, you will need to have Firefox and
geckodriver installed on your machine::

    uv run poe test

If this does not work for some reason and you would like to skip ui-related
tests on your machine, please invoke the test suite with::

    uv run poe test -m "not ui"

In order to run only specific tests, invoke::

    # Run tests by module name or function name.
    uv run poe test -k test_cli

    # Run tests by tags.
    uv run poe test -m "not (remote or slow)"


****************
Build OCI images
****************

Before building OCI images, you will need a recent wheel package. In order to
build one from the current working tree, run::

    pip install build
    python -m build --wheel

To build the OCI images suitable to run on Docker, Podman, Kubernetes, and friends,
invoke::

    export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1
    export COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1
    export BUILDKIT_PROGRESS=plain

    docker build \
        --tag=local/wetterdienst \
        --file=.github/release/Dockerfile \
        .

In order to build images for other platforms than ``linux/amd64``, use the
``--platform`` option, For ARM 64-bit::

    docker build \
        --tag=local/wetterdienst \
        --file=.github/release/Dockerfile \
        --platform=linux/arm64 \
        .

For ARM 32-bit::

    docker build \
        --tag=local/wetterdienst \
        --file=.github/release/Dockerfile \
        --platform=linux/arm/v7 \
        .
