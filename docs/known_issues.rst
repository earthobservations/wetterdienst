Known Issues
############

Besides the officially listed issues on the wetterdienst repository, there are other issues regarding
running wetterdienst listed below that may be environment specific and are not likely fixable on our side.

Cache runs stale
****************

Also we are quite happy with our `FSSPEC <https://github.com/fsspec/filesystem_spec>`_ backed caching system from time
to time you may run into some unexplainable error with empty result sets like
`here <https://github.com/earthobservations/wetterdienst/issues/678>`_ and in this case it is worth try dropping the
cache entirely.

Running this

.. code-block:: python

    import wetterdienst
    wetterdienst.info()

will guide you the path to your caching folder.
